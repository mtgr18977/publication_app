# How to use the Network Connector dashboard


In this document, you’ll find a step-by-step guide on how to use the dashboard **Network Connector**, to view data on the connection status, agents and logs.

## Requirements

It’s necessary to have the agent **Network Connector** installed. To do this, follow the steps in the document [How to install Network Connector](/v4/docs/network-connector-how-to-install-network-connector).

## View the Network Connector dashboard

To view data from the **Network Connector** dashboard, follow the steps below:

1. Access the Segura platform using **SSH** on port 59022 with the administrative user `mt4adm`.
2. Run the command: `sudo orbit network-connector status`.

Once the command is executed, the following screen will be displayed:

| Item 	    | Description                                                        	                    |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name 	    | Name used for agent.                                         	                            |
| Port   	| Port used for the agent.                                                                  |
| Primary   | Main network connector agent status.                 	                                    |
| Secondary | Status of the secondary network connector agent.                 	                        |
| Offline   | The agent is offline.                                           	                        |
| Online    | The agent is connected with (number of connections) (bandwidth consumption).              |
| Tunns     | The number of devices and ports connected to the agent determines the “Tunns”. For example, a device on port 22 (192.168.0.10:22) results in Tunns equal to 1. If the same device uses another port, such as 443 (192.168.0.10:443), then Tunns equals 2. Adding another device with a new port, Tunns increases to 3.              |
| Version (P/S) | Agent version.                                                                        |

:::(Info) (Info) 
A Tunn is not added if there is already a tunnel to the same device + port.

## View logs on the Network Connector dashboard

To access the logs generated by **Network Connector Server** on the Network Connector *dashboard*, follow the steps below:
