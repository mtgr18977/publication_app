During the senhasegura installation, it configured some Scan parameters so that Scans can be automatically done in different environments and a certain period of time.

senhasegura performs these types of Discovery: 

* Domain
* Device
* Containers
* URL Certificates.

Depending on the type of Discovery, the screen has the following tabs:



| **Tabs** | Domain | Device | Containers | Application |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Connection** | X | X | X | X |
| **Searches** | X | X | X | X |
| **Search parameters** | X |  |  |  |
| **Filters for search** | X |  |  |  |
| **Containers** |  |  | X |  |
| **Plugins** |  | X |  | X |
| **Execution** | X | X | X | X |
| **Import** | X | X |  |  |
| **DevOps** | X | X | X |  |
| **Certificates** | X | X | X |  |

  


CautionAt the moment, the senhasegura certificate discovery module can only import certificates with the .crt and .cer extensions, for certificates protected with passwords, a credential needs to be given.  


For better understanding, the header part of each type will be explained once each tab.

To create a Discovery go to the menu **Discovery ➔ Settings ➔ Discovery** and on the Report action button, click on ***New***.
