## Applications and uninstallers report

This report shows all applications automatically mapped by GO Endpoint Manager services or executed. There is a list of all application uninstallers identified on workstations. As they are also applications, their registration actions are identical to the application report actions.

![Application report](https://cdn.document360.io/5a1d58df-64ce-42a2-8b23-688477d32f33/Images/Documentation/image-1677186148412.png)Application report

Because an application is unique to senhasegura, regardless of its installation folder and the name of its binary, GO Endpoint Manager can identify its different versions and centralize the registration to create segregation. The administrator can identify the different versions installed on his machine park. Its logging actions also allow you to view run events.

## Event report

This report details all Workstations, Applications, Uninstallers, Control Panel, and DLLs report logs. Every automatic or intentional user action from GO Endpoint Manager is centralized. You have access to all filters and combinations to identify events on workstations.

CautionOnly DLLs added after the process has started are analyzed. If a user tries to open a file with a DLL that is not trusted, the system generates an event called **Untrusted DLL execution attempt** and shuts down the application. The event will be notified via SYSLOG and available for email configuration.![](https://cdn.document360.io/5a1d58df-64ce-42a2-8b23-688477d32f33/Images/Documentation/image-1677256974102.png)Event report
