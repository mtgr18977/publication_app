2. In the side menu, select **+ Integrations > Access keys**.
3. From the list, locate the access key authorization you want to change.
4. In the **Action** column, click the three vertical dots.
5. In the drop-down menu, select **Clone**, represented by the two sheets of paper icon.
5. A confirmation pop-up question similar to the following one is displayed:

 **“Are you sure you want to clone [name]?”**

6. Click **Yes** to confirm.

A pop-up window with the message **“Access key successfully cloned”** confirms the action. Below the message, you can click **Change** to be directed to the **Update** access key screen, where you can change the access key authorization information; or click **Close** to close the window.


Once cloned, the word **'Copy'** will appear, between parentheses, below the application’s name in the **Application** column, and the column **Expiration date** will be empty.
